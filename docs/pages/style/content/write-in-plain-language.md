# Write in plain language

We do the hard work to make content simple for people to understand.

## Standards

Aim for a sixth grade reading level or lower. Keep sentences short and simple. Use smaller, more common words.

We recommend a sixth grade reading level because:

* Familiar words let people read with less effort.
* Kids who translate English content for their non-English-speaking parents can do this more easily.
* Machine translation at this reading level is more accurate.

## Why this is important

Plain language lowers reading barriers and is clear and accessible to everyone, including readers with disabilities and limited English fluency. Plain language removes the struggle from finding and acting on information.

## How to do this in your writing

Check reading levels with the [Hemingway Editor](http://hemingwayapp.com/). Eliminate very-hard-to-read sentences and minimize hard-to-read sentences. Check the reading level every time you edit content.

* Use simple words.
  * Your content still needs to be accurate. Do not sacrifice clarity for simplicity.
* Explain jargon when you have to use it. This includes proper nouns and government-centric terms.
* Spell out an acronym the first time you use it on a page.
  * Add the acronym in parentheses after the full name. Use the acronym afterwards.
  * If the name only appears once on the page, do not add the acronym.
  * If an acronym is better known than the full name, use it instead.
  * Do not assume because the term is familiar in your workplace that everyone knows it. When in doubt, spell out the acronym.
* Use [positive phrases](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/concise/use-positive-language/) instead of negative ones. They’re easier to understand.
  * For example: write **lack** instead of **do not have**.
* Use [active voice](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-active-voice/) and strong verbs.
  * Do not use [hidden verbs](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/avoid-hidden-verbs/).
* Do not use gerunds with **is** or **are**. A gerund is a verb that ends in -ing. 
  * For example: write **He helps** instead of **He is helping**.
* Write in present tense.
* When using **it**, **this**, **those**, and **these**, double check to make sure it’s clear what the pronoun refers to.
* Do not use directional references like **as above**.
* Write out or abbreviate months in dates instead of using numbers. Some cultures interpret 9/5 as May 9 instead of September 5.
  * Use numerals instead of spelling out numbers.
  * Only go to one decimal place. Only use decimals when you need to.
  * Use commas in numbers over 999. This helps people understand the order of magnitude.
* Use the serial comma (also called the Oxford comma) to reduce confusion. It’s the comma that comes before **and** in a list of 3 or more.
  * For example: _We brought apples, bananas, and oranges_.
