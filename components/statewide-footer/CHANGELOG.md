# CHANGELOG for ds-statewide-footer
`ds-statewide-footer`


# 1.0.6
* Added aria-hidden attribute to cagov svg icon, so it is hidden from assistive technologies.

# 1.0.5
* Linted and formatted code per root eslint/prettier settings.
* Added unit test.

# 1.0.4
* Added padding right 24px to the cagov-logo to make there is always consistent space between footer-secondary-links and cagov-logo.

# 1.0.3
* Updated statewide footer container's padding to 16px instead of 1rem to make it consistent with other components.

# 1.0.2
* Changed space between ca.gov icon and first link to 24px. Made distance from the footer's top to the ca.gov logo 16px in mobile.

# 1.0.1
* Updated ca.gov logo to have cagov colors, not the colors of the department/agency. Removed link from the ca.gov icon since there is actual spelled out link to the ca.gov website next to it.
