# Feature card changelog

## 2.0.1

- Removed redundant package-lock.json (due to workspaces config in monorepo). This fixes vulnerability in the npm `ip` package.

## 2.0.0

- Moved built CSS into dist folder.

## 1.0.7

- Updated color variables and changed button class to btn-primary

## 1.0.6

- Remove loading="lazy" attribute from main image because it is usually above the fold and should not have any display delays
- Use an H1 instead of h2 in the sample markup because the feature card usually holds the most important page header

## 1.0.5

- Limit the h3 definition to .cagov-featured-section, so it doesn't reset all h3 across the site.

## 1.0.4

- Linted and formatted code per root eslint/prettier settings.
- Added unit test.

## 1.0.3

- Added CHANGELOG file and added src folder with index.scss file to be consistent with the rest of the components.
