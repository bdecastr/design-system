## Theming

Theme-specific stylesheets are generated by the build command.

A theme is composed of:

```
@import '../colorschemes/_cannabis'; /* theme colors */
@import '../_core';
```

- A themed file defining specific values for standard colors
- The core file which includes all sass files in the base-css package

## CSS variables

All variables are defined using CSS variables with a fallback value.

There are variables defined in src/_variables.scss which are shared between all themes.

Theme specific values are defined in src/colorschemes
